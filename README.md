Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to implement automated tests for a basic e-commerce shopping cart. The following functionalities are tested:

    Adding products to the cart
    Removing products from the cart
    Verifying the correct product, price, and total in the cart
    Testing across multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

These scenarios are essential for testing e-commerce websites, and by automating them, this project demonstrates the power of Selenium WebDriver for test automation.
