Project Overview

This project showcases automated testing for a basic e-commerce shopping cart. It aims to verify key functionalities that are essential for an efficient and user-friendly shopping experience. By automating these scenarios, the project highlights the capabilities of Selenium WebDriver and JUnit for end-to-end test automation.
Key Features Tested

    Adding Products to the Cart
    Verifies that products can be successfully added to the shopping cart.

    Removing Products from the Cart
    Ensures users can remove items from the cart and that the cart reflects the updated total.

    Cart Verification
    Confirms that:
        The correct product(s) are displayed in the cart.
        Prices are accurate for individual items and the total price is calculated correctly.

These tests are critical for maintaining the reliability and accuracy of an e-commerce platform.

Tools and Frameworks Used

    Selenium WebDriver
    A powerful tool for automating web browsers. It enables interactions with the website such as clicking buttons, entering text, and verifying page content.

    JUnit 5
    A robust testing framework for writing, organizing, and running automated test cases. It integrates seamlessly with Selenium to create structured and reusable test methods.

    Java
    The programming language used to implement the tests. Java is well-suited for Selenium due to its strong community support and compatibility.

Setup and Execution
Prerequisites

    Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 11 or later installed.
    Maven: For managing dependencies and building the project.
    ChromeDriver: Required to run tests in the Chrome browser. The chromedriver executable should match your Chrome browser version.
    Browser: Google Chrome installed on your system.
